# Mobidict - [![Travis status](https://travis-ci.org/ismail/mobidict.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ismail/mobidict) [![Appveyor status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/h0m5v13mfw3fgr7d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ismail/mobidict)

A dictionary application that reads MOBI dictionary files. Works on Linux, macOS and Windows. Uses [Qt](https://www.qt-project.org) and [libmobi](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/libmobi).

mobidict does **NOT** support DRM'd files, you'll have to undrm them and put the resulting mobi files in the **Dictionaries** directory in your home.

## Credits
- Bartek Fabiszewski - for creating libmobi and tirelessly answering my questions about it.
