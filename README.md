# mobidict

A dictionary application that reads MOBI dictionary files. Works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Uses [Qt](https://www.qt-project.org) and [libmobi](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/libmobi).

mobidict does **NOT** support DRM'd files, you'll have to undrm them and put the resulting mobi files in the **Dictionaries** directory in your home.
